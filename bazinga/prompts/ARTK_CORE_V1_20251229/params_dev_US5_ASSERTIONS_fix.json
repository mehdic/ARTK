When used in Vitest, if the Playwright timeout exceeds Vitest's test timeout, the test fails.\n\nRecommended Fix:\n- Reduce Playwright expect timeout in tests to be well under Vitest's 5s default\n- Or explicitly set shorter timeouts on assertions: expect(locator).toBeVisible({ timeout: 2000 })\n- Or use mockPlaywrightExpect helper that doesn't actually wait\n\nRun `npm test -- --filter assertions` after fixes.",
