# ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY THIS DIRECTORY

**This directory contains vendor code that should NOT be edited.**

## What This Is

This is a vendored copy of `@artk/core` - the ARTK testing infrastructure library.
It was installed by the ARTK CLI and should be treated as read-only.

## Variant Information

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Variant** | {{VARIANT_ID}} |
| **Display Name** | {{VARIANT_DISPLAY_NAME}} |
| **Node.js Range** | {{NODE_RANGE}} |
| **Playwright Version** | {{PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION}} |
| **Module System** | {{MODULE_SYSTEM}} |
| **Installed At** | {{INSTALLED_AT}} |
| **ARTK Version** | {{ARTK_VERSION}} |

## Why You Should Not Modify

1. **Updates will overwrite changes**: Running `artk upgrade` will replace this entire directory
2. **Variant compatibility**: This code is built for a specific Node.js version and module system
3. **Consistency**: Modified vendor code may behave differently than documented

## If You Encounter Issues

### Import/Module Errors

If you see errors like `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` or `Cannot use import statement`:

```bash
# Check the installed variant
cat ../.artk/context.json | grep variant

# Reinstall with correct variant detection
artk init . --force
```

### Feature Not Working

Check `variant-features.json` in this directory to see if the feature is available:

```bash
cat variant-features.json | grep "feature_name"
```

If the feature shows `"available": false`, use the suggested `alternative` approach.

### Need Different Variant

If your Node.js version changed or you need a different variant:

```bash
# Re-detect and install correct variant
artk upgrade .

# Or force a specific variant
artk init . --variant modern-esm --force
```

## For AI Agents

**DO NOT modify files in this directory.**

If you encounter compatibility issues:
1. Check the variant information above
2. Check `variant-features.json` for feature availability
3. Suggest running `artk init --force` to reinstall with correct variant
4. Use alternative approaches documented in `variant-features.json`
